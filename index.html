  <h1>Check for Understanding</h1>
  <ol>
    
    <li>What does calling a function do?</li>
      <p>Calling a function is asking it to perform its task by declaring it.</p>
    
    <li>What are parameters? Give an example</li>
    <p>Parameters are pieces of information passed to a function. An example of parameter would be assigning a function with a color or assigning a width and height.</p>
    
    <li>Values in functions have a name. What is that name?</li>
    <p>The name of values in a function is called agruments.</p>
    
    <li>What is the difference between a parameter and arguments?</li>
    <p> The difference between parameter and arguments is that parameters show the wrods width and height when assigning these variables but with agruments all that is needed is the number and its placement will tell its width and height.</p>
    <p>Parameter: width = 3;
                  height = 4;</p>
    <p>Arguments: getArea(3,5);</p>
